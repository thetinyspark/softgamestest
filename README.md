## Infos

I chose to do this test in TDD with Karma & Jasmine in order to check the "clean code" section
(even thought it was not a criteria I think it is important).

I installed two libraries of mine : 
- @thetinyspark/coffe-maker , an architectural library (MVC + IoC)
- @thetinyspark/tiny-observer, an cross platform Observer  implementation, so I can make an Observer of every object if I want to (node + dom) 

### Where can I see the result ? 

You can see the by clicking on this link: https://preprod.the-tiny-spark.com/games/softgames/


### Problems I faced
- Actually , I spent most of the time in this challenge on npm issues 
( because of pixi.js 7.42 requirement and other little things but this one was tough ). 

- I had something in mind for the fire effect, but I was running out of time because of 
npm issues, so I Chose a fire effect on codepen and slightly modified it. 

- Well, I tried to maintain a consistant git history, but eh, running out of time as I previously said eheh.
